# IMDBifier
Chrome extension which can extract IMDB credits from an Excel spreadsheet and add them to the IMDB add credit webpage.

# How to Install
This is an unpacked chrome extension, so the typical installation route applies. This means you need to navigate to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, select load unpacked extension, and select this folder.

# How to Use
The Excel spreadsheet must have a very specific format, with the name of the role of the person in the 1st column and the name of the person in the 2nd column. Navigate to the IMDB add credits page, and click on the extension (the actual icon in your upper bar). This will add a button near the bottom of the page which will say "Upload File". Click this button, select your Excel spreadsheet, and enjoy!
